This project was done for the final assignment of CSIS2420 (Data Structure 
& Algorithms)

My partner, John Rangel Trejo, and I decided to utilize the PokeApi and 
build a pokemon app that users could see the relations between pokemon 
types and pokemon.

The main objective of the project was to utilize a graph.  We did so with 
Princeton's algs4 code that you can find at 
https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/.

For those that just want to run the program:

1) You need to have JDK v11 or later, and you can find the downloads for 
the JDK at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

2) Download our program's runnable jar file - (COMING SOON)

For those cloning our repository, you'll need the Algs4 jar file found in 
the same Princeton link above (about halfway down the page).  

For those looking to understand our code, some basic familiarity with 
Maven projects, Java Swing (UI), how to make/handle http requests in java, 
and Jackson library (parses JSON) would really help.  Thanks for viewing 
our project!
